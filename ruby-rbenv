How To Install Ruby on Rails with rbenv on Ubuntu 16.04
sudo apt-get update

Next, letâ€™s install the dependencies required for rbenv and Ruby with apt-get:

sudo apt-get install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm3 libgdbm-dev

Install rbenv

Now we are ready to install rbenv. Let's clone the rbenv repository from git. .

    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv

From here, you should add ~/.rbenv/bin to your $PATH so that you can use rbenv's command line utility. Also adding ~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init to your ~/.basrc file will let you load rbenv automatically.

    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
Next, source rbenv by typing:

     source ~/.bashrc

You can check to see if rbenv was set up properly by using the type command, which will display more information about rbenv:

    type rbenv
Your terminal window should output the following:

Output
rbenv is a function

Install ruby-build, which we will install as a plugin for rbenv through git:

    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build

Install Ruby

rbenv install -l

rbenv install 2.5.0

rbenv global 2.5.0

Verify that Ruby was properly installed by checking your version number:

ruby -v

we will turn off local documentation for each gem
    echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc
    gem install bundler

rbenv rehash

Updating rbenv

As we installed rbenv manually using git, we can upgrade our installation to the most recent version at any time:

    cd ~/.rbenv
    git pull
