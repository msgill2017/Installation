Install Rails


    gem install rails

If you would like to install a specific version of Rails, you can list the valid versions of Rails by doing a search, 
which will output a long list of possible versions. We can then install a specific version, such as 4.2.7:

    gem search '^rails$' --all
    gem install rails -v 4.2.7

rbenv rehash
